# Challenge 1
# In the database, there is the concept of Customer and Employee. The company wants to create a
# new concept, called Contact, which may be either a customer or an employee. You are asked to
# develop a unified view over the Customer and Employee tables to provide this new concept. The
# view should use the common attributes between both tables.

	create or replace view Contact(FirstName, LastName, Address, City, State, Country, PostalCode, Phone, Fax, Email) as
		select FirstName, LastName, Address, City, State, Country, PostalCode, Phone, Fax, Email
		from Customer

		union

		select FirstName, LastName, Address, City, State, Country, PostalCode, Phone, Fax, Email
		from Employee;

# Challenge 3
# The company is worried about the quality of data in the Customer table. Use a data profiling
# tool to conduct an analysis and provide your own conclusions with respect to completeness,
# string fields, referential integrity, and value distributions.

	-> Completeness:
		- 50 out of the 59 records have some kind of information missing.
		- Only 10 out of the 59 records use the Company field.
		- Some records (29/59) do not use the State field.
		- Some records (4/59) have no PostalCode. 
		- Only 11 ou of the 59 records use the Fax field.
		- 1 record has no Phone.

	-> Referential Integrity:

		- On average, the field Email has the longest strings (21.017 chars).
		- Only the fields FirstName, State and Email have a single word and no spaces in all records.
		- Only the Email field is written entirely in lowercase.

		- Most of the chars in PostalCode (273/332), Phone (676/973) and Fax (138/208) are digits.
		- Diacritic chars are used in all fields except for State, Country, PostalCOde, Phone and Fax.

	-> Value Distributions:
		- 49 out of the 59 customers are individuals. The remaining 10 represent 10 different companies.
		- There are customers form 24 distinct countries. Most of them are from the USA (13), Canada (8), Brazil (5) and France(5).     
		- All of the 59 customers are supported by only 3 distinct Representatives, with id's 3, 4 and 5.   

# Challenge 4
# The company would like to build a data warehouse to analyze sales and quantity by track, album, 
# artist, customer, geography and time. These should be organized into appropriate dimensions, namely:
#	• a track dimension with track name, album title, artist name
#	• a customer dimension with full name, city, country
#	• a time dimension with day, month, year
# You should propose a star schema for this purpose, and provide the instructions for creating such 
# data warehouse.   

	In MySQL execute the following command:
